# Contents

This repository contains sample implementations of design patterns in TypeScript.

Please note that there might be better alternatives to use for this specific programming language. It is not the main goal of this repository to provide optimal way of solving the problem, but to show the most classic implementation of certain design patters.

# Usage

Each design pattern is located in its own directory. Examples can be run with Visual Studio Code debugger within Node.js environment. Each directory contains index.ts file, which should be used as entry point for debugger.
